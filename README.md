# Multiplayer Battleship Game

## Application Suitability

Here are key reasons why microservices are ideal for this project:

1. **Separation of Game Logic and User Management:**:

   - Game logic (such as managing moves and game states) and user-related tasks (like authentication, registration, and scorekeeping) are distinct responsibilities. Breaking them into independent services makes the system easier to maintain and scale as needed.

2. **Enhanced Availability**:

   - Distributed systems ensure higher availability by isolating failures. If the authentication service encounters an issue, it wonâ€™t affect the service that deals with game logic, so players that are already in a game won't encounter issues. This modularity improves the overall resilience of the system.

3. **Improved Scalability**:

   - Different components like matchmaking, game sessions, and player stats will experience varying loads. Microservices allow each of these components to scale independently. For example, the API Gateway managing WebSocket connections can handle spikes in player activity, while services like matchmaking or game sessions can be scaled separately to ensure smooth performance during peak gaming times. This flexibility ensures that even when a large number of players are looking for matches or playing simultaneously, the rest of the system remains unaffected.

4. **Optimized Real-Time Communication**:

- Real-time updates are crucial for synchronized gameplay. By isolating real-time tasks in a service the system ensures swift communication of moves and game state changes. Meanwhile, other services like managing user profiles and authentication would be separate, keeping gameplay smooth and responsive even with many concurrent players.

Real-world examples of projects that are similar and employ microservices:

- **Hearthstone (by Blizzard Entertainment)**: A digital collectible card game that supports online multiplayer matches, player progression, and real-time interactions. It leverages microservices to handle game logic, player data, and match-making.

- **Among Us (by Innersloth)**: A multiplayer game that involves real-time interaction, player roles, and in-game communication. It uses microservices to handle game sessions, player data, and real-time chat.

### API Gateway

The API Gateway is the entry point for all client requests and performs several key functions:

- **Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request URL and method.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of microservices to ensure even load and high availability.
- **WebSocket Management**: Establishes and manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication between clients and the services.
- **Service Discovery**: Integrates with a service registry to discover and route requests to the available instances of microservices.

### Battleship Service

The Battleship Service is responsible for handling the core game functionality, including:

- **Game Logic**: Manages the rules and mechanics of the Battleship game, including turn management, hit/miss calculations, and game state updates.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time updates about the game state to clients via the gateway.

### Profile Service

The Profile Service handles user-related functionality and data management, including:

- **Authentication & Registration**: Manages user authentication, registration, and login processes.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks and updates user scores and game history, communicating with the Battleship Service via gRPC to synchronize game-related data.

### Service Discovery

Handles the microservice discovery process, including:

- **Registering**: Registers service names to their respective service addresses.
- **Health Checks**: Periodically pings the services it has registered to see if they are still alive.
- **Caching**: Caches the service names and their addresses in redis.

### Prometheus

Collects time-series metrics from the Battleship game microservices and API Gateway, including:

- **API Gateway Monitoring**: Collects metrics on incoming request counts, response times, request errors, and overall traffic through the API Gateway, giving insights into load and performance.
- **Service-Specific Metrics**: Monitors each microservice individually (Battleship and Profile services) for metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, and request counts.

### Grafana

Provides real-time visualization for all aspects of the Battleship multiplayer game that Prometheus collects.

### ETL Service

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service for the Battleship multiplayer game would consolidate and transform data from the two primary services, the Battleship Service and the Profile Service, which use different databases (MongoDB and PostgreSQL respectively).

#### Extract

The ETL service retrieves data from the two distinct databases.

#### Transform

In the transform phase, the ETL service cleans, structures, and aggregates the data, preparing it for analytics or reporting.

#### Load

The ETL service loads the consolidated and transformed data into a centralized datastore, a data warehouse. This enables efficient querying and analysis.

### Communication patterns

REST will be used for client-API Gateway communication due to its simplicity and broad compatibility for standard API interactions, while WebSockets handle real-time updates and bidirectional communication essential for live gameplay. gRPC will be used for battleship service to profile service communication as well as for communication between the api gateway and service discovery.

### Deployment and Scaling

Each component, such as the two microservices, API Gateway, service discovery, Redis, and the databases, will have its own Docker image. These images will be used to create and run containers, which can be deployed and scaled independently. Docker Compose can manage these containers, ensuring they can communicate with each other as required. Docker handles the networking and communication between containers, allowing for flexible scaling and deployment.

### Run/test the project

To test the project locally git clone the project, change directory to src, since that is where `docker-compose.yml` file is located, and run `docker-compose up --build`. The services register themselves to Service Discovery when they're up and log a successfull registration message if no issues were encountered. The API Gateway synchronizes with the Service Discovery when it needs the address of a service it wants to forward a request to. The endpoints are located in `pad1.postman_collection.json`, they can be imported in postman and tested.
